\subsection*{Current Challenges and Future Work}

\subsubsection*{Data Collection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual robot control for LiDAR data acquisition is tedious and time-consuming
    \item Need to implement autonomous navigation 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Technical Knowledge Gaps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) fundamentals require further study
    \item Mapping relationship between physical and simulated environments unclear
    \item Occupancy grid construction from LiDAR data needs research
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Abstraction Level}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Struggling to understand and reduce infinite real-world detail to finite usable data
    \item Should focus on tile-to-tile navigation rather than millimeter precision
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Scope Reduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prioritize discrete tile-based movement over continuous positioning
    \item Focus on traversal between adjacent tiles as primary navigation unit
\end{itemize}
